ABE8.20-m is noted to have higher efficiency than 7th generation ABEs (ABE7.10 and ABEmax), with a great deal of the increased efficiency coming from increased editing efficiency on bases at the periphery of the core editing window.

The core base editing activity window is  positions 4–9, counting the PAM as positions 21–23. This is similar to prior ABEs (e.g. ABE7.10). However, as with earlier base editors, some activity may be noted 3rd and 8th positions as well, with minor activity occasionally found at up to the 12th base.

The APOBEC used is Rat APOBEC-1. The core base editing activity window is  positions 4–8, counting the PAM as positions 21–23. This is the same as prior CBE (i.e. BE4).  However, as with earlier base editors, some activity may be noted 3rd and 12th positions as well. See Figure S8 from Koblan et al., 2018 for precise details. The editing efficiency in the activity window was noted to be 45±7.1% across 5 genomic loci in HEK cells, although this efficiency was measured prior to NLS optimization, which was found to increase efficiency by 1.3 fold on average. It was  noted by the authors  that the primary bottleneck for editing efficiency in mamallian cells appeared to be transfection and expression efficiency.
