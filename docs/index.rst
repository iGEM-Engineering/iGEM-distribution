Introduction
---------------

What are we building? And how is it different from previous distributions?

- :doc:`What is the Distribution 2.0 <introduction/distribution>`


Getting started
---------------

We know that this way of working may be unfamiliar to many of you, but we believe that it's the best way to make the development of the new distribution as open and collaborative as possible!
Don't worry if you've never used github before:

- :doc:`Guide to Github <getting_started/github>`


Contributing
------------

There are 6 main ways to contribute to the iGEM distribution, and we appreciate help with any one!

1. :doc:`Contributing DNA packages <contributing/dna>`
2. :doc:`Reviewing DNA packages <contributing/dna>`
3. :doc:`Commenting/feedback on packages and issues <contributing/commenting>`
4. :doc:`Using the distribution <contributing/using>`
5. :doc:`Improving documentation <contributing/documentation>`
