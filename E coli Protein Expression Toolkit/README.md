# Package: E. coli Protein Expression Toolkit

Use the DNA parts of the collection to assemble the expression plasmids for the protein of your choice, tailored to the resources present in your lab. The collection enables thousands of combinations for each gene of choice. Full power of the collection can be explored using pipetting robots. The collection is compatible with all the CDSs present in the Open Enzyme collections. (taken directly from https://stanford.freegenes.org/collections/igem-collection-2-0/products/expression-tookit)
