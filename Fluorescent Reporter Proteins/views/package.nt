It has a tyrosine-based chromophore, giving it substantially higher brightness, faster chromophore maturation and higher pH stability than blue fluorescent proteins with a histidine in the chromophore. Subach et. al. started with a red fluorescent protein (TagRed) and converted it to a bright blue monomeric protein. See the article listed in source.
