<https://github.com/iGEM-Engineering/iGEM-distribution/Open%20Enzymes%20Collection/BasicParts> <http://sbols.org/v3#description> "The Open Enzyme Collection consists of 81 genes for enzymes that are \"workhorses\" of molecular biology, including DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases, DNA ligases, reverse transcriptases and restriction enzymes. The enzymes are useful in both basic and applied fields as diverse as genomics, diagnostics, biodiversity, synthetic biology, DNA origami, immunology, biochemistry and more.\n\nThe foundational technologies enabled by this collection of include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloning, isothermal amplification, reverse transcription of RNA into DNA, and dNTP synthesis. Additionally, the Open Enzyme collection contains enzyme genes for fixing damaged and degraded DNA prior to amplification, enzymes for cutting protein sequences to remove unwanted parts, and DNA-binding proteins that can be fused with other enzymes to improve functionality.\n\nThe Open Bioeconomy Lab designed and codon-optimized the Open Enzymes parts for expression in Escherichia coli bacteria. All enzymes are obtained from expired patents or for various reasons are not encumbered by patent rights.

<https://github.com/iGEM-Engineering/iGEM-distribution/Open%20Enzymes%20Collection/CompositeParts> <http://sbols.org/v3#description> "The Open Enzyme Collection consists of 81 genes for enzymes that are \"workhorses\" of molecular biology, including DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases, DNA ligases, reverse transcriptases and restriction enzymes. The enzymes are useful in both basic and applied fields as diverse as genomics, diagnostics, biodiversity, synthetic biology, DNA origami, immunology, biochemistry and more.\n\nThe foundational technologies enabled by this collection of include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloning, isothermal amplification, reverse transcription of RNA into DNA, and dNTP synthesis. Additionally, the Open Enzyme collection contains enzyme genes for fixing damaged and degraded DNA prior to amplification, enzymes for cutting protein sequences to remove unwanted parts, and DNA-binding proteins that can be fused with other enzymes to improve functionality.\n\nThe Open Bioeconomy Lab designed and codon-optimized the Open Enzymes parts for expression in Escherichia coli bacteria. All enzymes are obtained from expired patents or for various reasons are not encumbered by patent rights.
