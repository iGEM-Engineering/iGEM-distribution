# Package: JUMP Collection

Joint Universal Modular Plasmids (JUMP) is a modular vector platform for Golden Gate (PhytoBrick) and Biobrick assembly based on Standard European Vector Architecture (SEVA). The collection includes plasmids with 10 different replication origins allowing for flexibility in both copy number and chassis. A selection of the JUMP collection has been made available to iGEM teams through the iGEM 2022 Distribution. This collection was kindly provided under the OpenMTA by Marcos Valenzuela-Ortega at the French Lab, University of Edinburgh.
