Friendzymes' primary goals are to democratize strain engineering and recombinant protein manufacturing and purification. For manufacturing, this collection contains an expansion of the FreeGenes Open Yeast Collection, including target P. pastoris-optimized target enzymes for recombinant production (such as Eco31I, an IP-free BsaI isoschizomer and its cognate methyltransferases), additional purification tags, an anti-His tag antibody for protein blotting and quantification, and additional yeast promoters. Further, this collection contains complements to the FreeGenes Bacillus subtilis Secretion Tag Library Plasmids, for recombinant protein production and secretion from B. subtilis. These include B. subtilis  promoters, target proteins for production like Pfu-Sso7d polymerase, and various B. subtilis regulatory elements. For strain engineering, we include E. coli origins or replication, E. coli, B. subtilis and P. pastoris selection markers, counterselection markers for E. coli, an origin of transfer for conjugation from E. coli to other bacterial species, homology arm pairs for genomic integration into B. subtilis and P. pastoris, and 5' and 3' recombinase site parts for insertion, deletion or inversion of synthetic genetic elements. Many of these parts are not elements of a canonical transcription unit, and do not have clearly defined part types in the MoClo/uLoop assembly standard; moreover, for some parts, their insertion into the transcription unit would require changing the overhangs on the core promoter, RBS, CDS, and/or terminator parts. To address this challenge, we designed a high-fidelity, backwards-compatible expansion of the MoClo assembly standard, AllClo (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TICnbGYY96myM7TPXWwBsLvyadgSfmtbVTGsUN5iMI8/edit?usp=sharing), all with a single 26-overhang set that includes all uLoop overhangs and the vector assembly overhangs used in the Open Yeast Collection, and whose predicted ligation fidelity in a 26-part assembly is 96%. We further designed a set of part switching linkers, that take as input canonical uLoop transcription unit components and output those parts with new 5' and 3' overhangs. These part switching reactions enable, for instance, insertion of recombination sites 5' to the promoter and/or 3' to the terminator in a TU, or ribozymes 3' to the promoter and 5' to the RBS/start site. In this way, standard uLoop parts can participate in assembly reactions that construct modular vector backbones, composite 5' and 3' UTRs, and multi-tagged CDSs. The part switching linkers were designed to proceed in two methods: with an orthogonal, linker-specific Type IIS restriction site (BbsI), or with a conditionally methylatable, idempotent BsaI restriction site (mBsaI), that is suppressed when the linker is cloned inside an E. coli cell expressing HpaII and/or MspI, and becomes active when the part is cloned into an MspI-/HpaII- strain or PCR amplified to remove the methylation sites. These parts and this expanded assembly standard have the potential to enable iGEM teams with tools and a framework to manufacture their own enzymatic reagents and perform their own sophisticated modification of strains' genomic background." .

<https://github.com/iGEM-Engineering/iGEM-distribution/Friendzymes/CompositeParts> <http://sbols.org/v3#description> "This collection is aimed at expanding what people are able to do with FreeGenes collections and the iGEM distribution, both in terms of genetic assembly and in terms of biomanufacturing. Friendzymes' primary goals are to democratize strain engineering and recombinant protein manufacturing and purification. For manufacturing, this collection contains an expansion of the FreeGenes Open Yeast Collection, including target P. pastoris-optimized target enzymes for recombinant production (such as Eco31I, an IP-free BsaI isoschizomer and its cognate methyltransferases), additional purification tags, an anti-His tag antibody for protein blotting and quantification, and additional yeast promoters. Further, this collection contains complements to the FreeGenes Bacillus subtilis Secretion Tag Library Plasmids, for recombinant protein production and secretion from B. subtilis. These include B. subtilis  promoters, target proteins for production like Pfu-Sso7d polymerase, and various B. subtilis regulatory elements. For strain engineering, we include E. coli origins or replication, E. coli, B. subtilis and P. pastoris selection markers, counterselection markers for E. coli, an origin of transfer for conjugation from E. coli to other bacterial species, homology arm pairs for genomic integration into B. subtilis and P. pastoris, and 5' and 3' recombinase site parts for insertion, deletion or inversion of synthetic genetic elements. Many of these parts are not elements of a canonical transcription unit, and do not have clearly defined part types in the MoClo/uLoop assembly standard; moreover, for some parts, their insertion into the transcription unit would require changing the overhangs on the core promoter, RBS, CDS, and/or terminator parts. To address this challenge, we designed a high-fidelity, backwards-compatible expansion of the MoClo assembly standard, AllClo (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TICnbGYY96myM7TPXWwBsLvyadgSfmtbVTGsUN5iMI8/edit?usp=sharing), all with a single 26-overhang set that includes all uLoop overhangs and the vector assembly overhangs used in the Open Yeast Collection, and whose predicted ligation fidelity in a 26-part assembly is 96%. We further designed a set of part switching linkers, that take as input canonical uLoop transcription unit components and output those parts with new 5' and 3' overhangs. These part switching reactions enable, for instance, insertion of recombination sites 5' to the promoter and/or 3' to the terminator in a TU, or ribozymes 3' to the promoter and 5' to the RBS/start site. In this way, standard uLoop parts can participate in assembly reactions that construct modular vector backbones, composite 5' and 3' UTRs, and multi-tagged CDSs. The part switching linkers were designed to proceed in two methods: with an orthogonal, linker-specific Type IIS restriction site (BbsI), or with a conditionally methylatable, idempotent BsaI restriction site (mBsaI), that is suppressed when the linker is cloned inside an E. coli cell expressing HpaII and/or MspI, and becomes active when the part is cloned into an MspI-/HpaII- strain or PCR amplified to remove the methylation sites. These parts and this expanded assembly standard have the potential to enable iGEM teams with tools and a framework to manufacture their own enzymatic reagents and perform their own sophisticated modification of strains' genomic background." .

The purpose of this linker, along with its 5’ partner, is to enable MoClo/uLoop promoters to undergo part switching on their 5' end (for instance, changing 'A'/GGAG to 'A2'/TAAC to enable insertion of 5' recombination site parts between the vector backbone and the promoter), without changing their 3' overhang or sequence. BsaI digestion of the linker exposes the MoClo/uLoop overhang 'B'/TACT on the 5' end, so the linker can assemble onto the 3’ end of MoClo/uLoop promoter parts. Subsequent BbsI digestion exposes the exact same overhang at the exact same location on the part ('B'/TACT), maintaining its 3' 'identity.' Annotated Benchling file here: https://benchling.com/s/seq-lpnRhGksOqtmKplZvauM?m=slm-zv85zaq6pNBNzVDnoCIP. Selection and amplification of type switched parts can be achieved in two ways. The linker contains a validated primer from row 185 of the supplementary table of this paper (https://academic.oup.com/synbio/article/3/1/ysx008/4817474#supplementary-data), which together with the primer on a 5’ part switch linker can amplify the assembled part. Alternatively, BsaI digestion exposes an overhang (GGCA, ’S4') on the 3’ end of the linker. Together with the exposed overhang on the 5’ end of a 5’ part switching linker (GACC, ’S1’), these overhangs enable parts to be cloned into a part type switching vector (VecSw), after which the part can be digested with BbsI to expose the new overhangs. The target selection marker overhangs are the same overhangs used for the target selection markers in the FreeGenes Open Yeast Collection. These overhangs are part of an assembly standard for modular construction of vector backbones (VecClo), which itself is subset (along with FiveClo, ThreeClo, ProClo and SwitchClo), of the design of a high fidelity, backwards-compatible expansion of the uLoop assembly standard called AllClo. The following are the overhangs in AllClo: VecClo (CGCT, CGAA, GCAA, GAGA, ACTA, AAAA, AAGG, ATGA, GGAG), FiveClo (GGAG, TAAC, TGTG, TACT), ProClo 2.0 (TACT, TCAA, GTGG, TCCA, AATG, AGGT, CAAG, CGGC, GCTT), ThreeClo (GCTT, ATAG, AGAC, CGCT), and SwitchClo (GACC, ATTC, CCGA, GGCA).

Together with the exposed overhang on the 3’ end of a 3’ part switching linker (GGCA, ’S4’), these overhangs enable parts to be cloned into a part type switching vector (VecSw), after which the part can be digested with BbsI to expose the new overhangs. The target selection marker overhangs are the same overhangs used for the target selection markers in the FreeGenes Open Yeast Collection. These overhangs are part of an assembly standard for modular construction of vector backbones (VecClo), which itself is subset (along with FiveClo, ThreeClo, ProClo and SwitchClo), of the design of a high fidelity, backwards-compatible expansion of the uLoop assembly standard called AllClo. The following are the overhangs in AllClo: VecClo (CGCT, CGAA, GCAA, GAGA, ACTA, AAAA, AAGG, ATGA, GGAG), FiveClo (GGAG, TAAC, TGTG, TACT), ProClo 2.0 (TACT, TCAA, GTGG, TCCA, AATG, AGGT, CAAG, CGGC, GCTT), ThreeClo (GCTT, ATAG, AGAC, CGCT), and SwitchClo (GACC, ATTC, CCGA, GGCA). Together, all 26 of these overhangs are predicted to yield 96% ligation in a Golden Gate reaction fidelity with BsaIHFv2 at 37C constant Golden Gate reaction (source: enter ID 20220203034906029259 at https://ggtools.neb.com/getset/run.cgi; the tool is based on the dataset from this paper: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238592). The following extra overhangs are available, and can be used to add new part types as needed to AllClo: GATA, AACA, ACGC, CCGC (in order of decreasing priority). Adding all these overhangs yields total fidelity of the 30-part of 93% (source: enter ID 20220203141728013343 into https://ggtools.neb.com/getset/run.cgi)" .

Usage: Any of the exisitng OYC yeast selection markers can be manually cloned into the BsmBI sites to create a Lox71-Lox66-flanked selection marker part for assembling genome integration vectors. After payload is integrated the selection marker can be excised using transient expression of the Cre recombinase. Sequence source:  Mutant LoxP sites: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9016639/.

The purpose of this linker, along with its 5’ partner, is to enable target selection markers to assemble into a MoClo/uLoop/AllClo vector as transcription units with an extra 5' part (such as a ribozyme) downstream of the promoter. This linker contains an internal ‘methylatable BsaI’ (mBsaI) site, CCGGTCTC, where the CCGG motif can be methylated by HpaII and/or MspI. If the linker is cloned onto a vector and transformed into an E. coli cell expressing HpaII and/or MspI, the methylation will suppress BsaI digestion at the mBsaI site, but not the outer flanking BsaI sites. Subsequent PCR or transformation into MspI-/HpaII- cells removes the methylation, enabling the mBsaI site to be cut (https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/19/e113/5050631?login=false). BsaI digestion of the linker exposes the 5' overhang TACT, so the linker can assemble onto the 3’ end of MoClo/uLoop Promoter parts.

The purpose of this linker, along with its 5’ partner, is to enable target selection markers to assemble into a MoClo/uLoop/AllClo vector as transcription units with an extra 3' part (such as a 3' recombination site), and to participate in multi-gene/multi-TU assembly using AllClo assembly linkers. This linker contains an internal ‘methylatable BsaI’ (mBsaI) site, CCGGTCTC, where the CCGG motif can be methylated by HpaII and/or MspI. If the linker is cloned onto a vector and transformed into an E. coli cell expressing HpaII and/or MspI, the methylation will suppress BsaI digestion at the mBsaI site, but not the outer flanking BsaI sites. Subsequent PCR or transformation into MspI-/HpaII- cells removes the methylation, enabling the mBsaI site to be cut (https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/19/e113/5050631?login=false). BsaI digestion of the methylated linker exposes the 5’ overhang ATGA, so the linker can assemble onto the 3’ end of VecClo tSel parts. Removal of the mBsaI methylation and subsequent BsaI digestion exposes a new 3’ overhang (ATAG) directly 5’ to the old overhang, so that the tSel part can now assemble with the 5’ overhang of AllClo 3' recombination sites (Rec3 parts). Annotated Benchling file here: https://benchling.com/s/seq-Ttrx1vyBF4Z2eMcDTNRd?m=slm-ceSMWOTwSOKy7SlJlwxW. Selection and amplification of type switched parts can be achieved in two ways. The linker contains a validated primer from row 185 of the supplementary table of this paper (https://academic.oup.com/synbio/article/3/1/ysx008/4817474#supplementary-data), which together with the primer on a 5’ part switch linker can amplify the assembled part. Alternatively, BsaI digestion of both the methylated and unmethylated linker exposes an overhang (GGCA, ’S4') on the 3’ end of the linker. Together with the exposed overhang on the 5’ end of a 5’ part switching linker (GACC, ’S1’), these overhangs enable parts to be cloned into a part type switching vector (VecSw), which can be transformed and then extracted from an HpaII-/MspI- E. coli strain, after which the part can be digested again with BsaI to expose the new overhangs. The target selection marker overhangs are the same overhangs used for the target selection markers in the FreeGenes Open Yeast Collection. These overhangs are part of an assembly standard for modular construction of vector backbones (VecClo), which itself is subset (along with FiveClo, ThreeClo, ProClo and SwitchClo), of the design of a high fidelity, backwards-compatible expansion of the uLoop assembly standard called AllClo. The following are the overhangs in AllClo: VecClo (CGCT, CGAA, GCAA, GAGA, ACTA, AAAA, AAGG, ATGA, GGAG), FiveClo (GGAG, TAAC, TGTG, TACT), ProClo 2.0 (TACT, TCAA, GTGG, TCCA, AATG, AGGT, CAAG, CGGC, GCTT), ThreeClo (GCTT, ATAG, AGAC, CGCT), and SwitchClo (GACC, ATTC, CCGA, GGCA).

The purpose of this linker, along with its 5’ partner, is to enable target selection markers to assemble into a MoClo/uLoop/AllClo vector as transcription units with an extra 3' part (such as a 3' recombination site) downstream of the terminator. This linker contains an internal ‘methylatable BsaI’ (mBsaI) site, CCGGTCTC, where the CCGG motif can be methylated by HpaII and/or MspI. If the linker is cloned onto a vector and transformed into an E. coli cell expressing HpaII and/or MspI, the methylation will suppress BsaI digestion at the mBsaI site, but not the outer flanking BsaI sites. Subsequent PCR or transformation into MspI-/HpaII- cells removes the methylation, enabling the mBsaI site to be cut (https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/19/e113/5050631?login=false). BsaI digestion of the linker exposes the 5' overhang CGCT, so the linker can assemble onto the 3’ end of MoClo/uLoop terminator/TU parts.

These overhangs are part of an assembly standard for modular construction of vector backbones (VecClo), which itself is subset (along with FiveClo, ThreeClo, ProClo and SwitchClo), of the design of a high fidelity, backwards-compatible expansion of the uLoop assembly standard called AllClo.

The following are the overhangs in AllClo: VecClo (CGCT, CGAA, GCAA, GAGA, ACTA, AAAA, AAGG, ATGA, GGAG), FiveClo (GGAG, TAAC, TGTG, TACT), ProClo 2.0 (TACT, TCAA, GTGG, TCCA, AATG, AGGT, CAAG, CGGC, GCTT), ThreeClo (GCTT, ATAG, AGAC, CGCT), and SwitchClo (GACC, ATTC, CCGA, GGCA). Together, all 26 of these overhangs are predicted to yield 96% ligation in a Golden Gate reaction fidelity with BsaIHFv2 at 37C constant Golden Gate reaction (source: enter ID 20220203034906029259 at https://ggtools.neb.com/getset/run.cgi; the tool is based on the dataset from this paper: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238592). The following extra overhangs are available, and can be used to add new part types as needed to AllClo: GATA, AACA, ACGC, CCGC (in order of decreasing priority).

The purpose of this linker, along with its 3’ partner, is to enable target selection markers to assemble into a MoClo/uLoop/AllClo vector as transcription units with an extra 5' part (such as a 5' recombination site), and to participate in multi-gene/multi-TU assembly using AllClo assembly linkers. This linker contains an internal ‘methylatable BsaI’ (mBsaI) site, CCGGTCTC, where the CCGG motif can be methylated by HpaII and/or MspI. If the linker is cloned onto a vector and transformed into an E. coli cell expressing HpaII and/or MspI, the methylation will suppress BsaI digestion at the mBsaI site, but not the outer flanking BsaI sites. Subsequent PCR or transformation into MspI-/HpaII- cells removes the methylation, enabling the mBsaI site to be cut (https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/19/e113/5050631?login=false). BsaI digestion of the methylated linker exposes the 3’ overhang AAGG, so the linker can assemble onto the 5’ end of VecClo tSel parts. Removal of the mBsaI methylation and subsequent BsaI digestion exposes a new 5’ overhang (TAAC) directly 5’ to the old overhang, so that the tSel part can now assemble with the 3’ overhang of AllClo 5' recombination sites.

Alternatively, BsaI digestion of both the methylated and unmethylated linker exposes an overhang (GACC, ’S1) on the 5’ end of the linker. Together with the exposed overhang on the 3’ end of a 3’ part switching linker (GGCA, ’S4’), these overhangs enable parts to be cloned into a part type switching vector (VecSw), which can be transformed and then extracted from an HpaII-/MspI- E. coli strain, after which the part can be digested again with BsaI to expose the new overhangs.
