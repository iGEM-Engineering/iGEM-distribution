# Package: Plastics Degradation

Plastic degradation enzymes, specifically PETase from papers (Yoshida et al. 2016, Austin et al. 2018) and iGEM teams (Exeter 2019, Toronto 2019). Some are protein twins, but have been optimized for E coli differently. This is not a complete collection and should include validated MHETase and BHETase.
